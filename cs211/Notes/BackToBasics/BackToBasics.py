Back to Basics

What is an object?
What is a class?

How does inheritance work?
How does overriding work?
WHat happens when I call foo.m(x,y)?
'''

'''Class:
Basically a dictionary
Keys are method names


Object:
Basically a dictionary
key: what is my class?
class of a class is a type


Inheritance:
copy a reference of what you inherited
pointer to the same code
Override:
Create its own table
New thing, not a copy
Pointer doesn't go to previous
Same name though

What happens when you make a method call
call eval method
first find it
then pass in object as the self
find class then find method, what ever it points to then run that

e is the object of class neg and eval is the method
e.eval()'''
